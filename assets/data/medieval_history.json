      "options": [
        "Iqta was an inheritable land grant given to soldiers.",
        "The Muqti (Iqta holder) had no obligation to maintain troops.",

      "difficulty": "Moderate",
      "tags": ["Administration", "Economy"],
      "explanation": {
        "core": "The Iqta system was a land revenue assignment. Instead of paying cash salaries, the Sultan assigned the right to collect revenue from a territory (Iqta) to an officer (Muqti/Wali).",
        "expert_note": "Crucially, Iqtas were initially non-hereditary and involved the military obligation to maintain a contingent for the Sultan.",
        "elimination": "Statement 1 is wrong because Iqtas were not inheritable until Firoz Shah Tughlaq's reign. Statement 4 is wrong as Iltutmish actually institutionalized the system."
