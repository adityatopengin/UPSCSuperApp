      "question": "Regarding the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), which of the following statements is/are correct?\n1. The inhabitants used both cotton and wool.\n2. The civilization was primarily secular; religious elements, though present, did not dominate the social scene.\n3. Harappans were the first to produce silver in the world.",
      "options": [
        "1 and 2 only",
        "2 and 3 only",
        "1 and 3 only",

      "difficulty": "Moderate",
      "tags": ["IVC", "Culture"],
      "explanation": {
        "core": "Spindles and whorls found in excavations prove the use of cotton and wool. While the 'Proto-Shiva' seal and Mother Goddess figurines exist, there is no evidence of large temples or a dominant priestly class, making it secular in social organization. Silver was indeed used, but its production 'first in the world' is traditionally attributed to the Chalcolithic cultures of the Near East or specifically identified later; however, in a UPSC context, statement 3 is often considered debatable or false compared to the definitive nature of 1 and 2.",
        "expert_note": "Focus on the absence of monumental religious structures (like Ziggurats of Mesopotamia) to distinguish IVC from other contemporary civilizations.",
        "elimination": "Statement 3 is often a trap. While Harappans used silver, the 'first in the world' claim is a common distractor used by UPSC to test specific archaeological certainty."

      "question": "With reference to the religious history of India, consider the following statements:\n1. Sautantrika and Sammitya were the sects of Jainism.\n2. Sarvastivadin held that the constituents of phenomena were not wholly momentary, but existed forever in a latent form.",

        "core": "Sautantrika and Sammitya are actually sub-sects of Buddhism, not Jainism. The Sarvastivada school (a branch of Theravada) believed that all things (dharmas) exist in the past, present, and future, which aligns with statement 2.",
